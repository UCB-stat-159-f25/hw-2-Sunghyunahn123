Used ChatGPT to find where to place “from ligotools import readligo as rl” and fix the import path.

Used ChatGPT to ask what, how, and why a “proper Python package” to understand. To make python package, GPT said init.py require as a package allows importing module without error.

I had suffered a issue with conda environment file (environment.yml), It took forever to install and creating environment (I was in infinite loop of loading.) Chatgpt suggest the view that maybe version is problem, and that's why loading and solving environment step kept fail. so I looked up what's proper version of python and scientific lib, and it work.
